# AmazonShopping
Given a shopping list, this automation robot scrapes top 25 products of each item on Amazon. Then, the program decide which one to buy based on its rating, number of reviews, and price. UiPath writes all the needed data from Amazon to Excel, then we have a python script that determines its "score."
